# BASIC-ally

QBasic 1.1 interpreter written in Rust.

Why? Because I can. And because I love learning new things.

## Project goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to run the famous [`NIBBLES.BAS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game)).
Will we get there? Who knows. But its often the journey that matters, not the destination.
